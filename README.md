# Update
In this update, I've created a relatively user-friendly menu system, where users can add charges, remove charges, view the system, and calculate the electric field/potential at a point of their choice in R3. I've also created and implemented a ChargeSystem class, greatly facilitating the storage and management of multiple charges together.

Coming up, I will be implementing other charge distributions, including lines, rings, and disks.

# Overview
This is a small library I wrote to store and manipulate 3D vectors.

I used Unity's Vector3 library as inspiration, and implemented the functions I felt were important.

It's designed to be usable for whatever application of 3D vectors one may need (3D physical simulation, doing your math HW, etc.).

I rather like dealing with vectors in calc and physics, so I thought it'd be fun to write some code and play around with them

# Features
Create an arbitrary number of vectors and perform a variety of operations on them

Operations on multiple vectors include: dot product, cross product, angle, distance, projection, reflection

Also: scalar-vector multiplication/division, vector addition/subtraction, vector magnitude, vector normalization
